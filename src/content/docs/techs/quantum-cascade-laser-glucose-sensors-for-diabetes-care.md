Non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, which can revolutionize diabetes care. Compact quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) reduce the need for invasive blood sampling, providing real-time and continuous monitoring.

### Implementation Details:

Design a portable FTIR spectrometer integrated with a QCL for detecting blood glucose via mid-infrared absorption.
Use data mining techniques to analyze glucose levels accurately.
Prototype wearable devices combining QCLs and biometric sensors for practical testing.
