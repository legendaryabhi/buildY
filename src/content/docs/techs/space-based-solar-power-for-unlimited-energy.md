title: Space-Based Solar Power for Unlimited Energy
description: Energy source for unlimited energy
---

Space Based Solar Power research has become one of prominent research work in the Aerospace domain. In SBSP, solar energy is normally collected by solar collectors or light structures of solar arrays and electronics devices convert it in some other form of energy i.e. microwave or laser for sending it on Earth.

Microwave energy source is safer to living beings than other energy resources. Considering this things, the idea of generating solar power from space have attracted many space enthusiastic people for doing new innovations.
