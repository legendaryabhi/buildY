The proposed single-qubit gate improves fault-tolerant quantum computers. This makes scalable quantum computing architectures more feasible.

### Implementation Details:

Utilize trapped neutral atoms with controlled nuclear spins as qubits.
Implement optical control techniques to perform single-qubit operations with high precision.
Test error correction protocols using nuclear spin transitions.
