> Perspective view of a 665 mg aerial robot that is powered by DEAs. This robot consists of four identical modules, and each module consists of an airframe, a DEA, a pair of wing hinges, wings, and transmissions. The robot carries four motion trackers to perform closed-loop flights. The robot dimensions are 6 × 2 × 1 cm.
