### Idea Proposed

A quantum-enhanced technique for detecting mid-to-far infrared electric fields absorbed and emitted by molecules. The method improves the sensitivity of time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) by using two-mode squeezed states (a quantum optical technique) to reduce noise beyond classical limits.

> Schematic of the experimental setup. A 1030-nm, 250- fs-duration, 100-khz- repetition- rate laser is split into two branches. the bottom branch (in red in the fig-ure) pumps a GaP crystal, leading to the generation of a single-cycle thz pulse (yellow). the top branch (p-polarized, also in red) seeds a parametric amplifier pumped bya synchronized laser (s-polarized, green in the figure) at 515 nm, generating a two-mode squeezed vacuum (p-polarized), consisting of photon number correlated signal(purple) and idler (cyan) pulses. the idler polarization is rotated to s-polarization using a half-wave plate (hWP). the signal pulse is used for the electro-optical (eO) detec-tion of the thz electric field while the idler is delayed to not interact with the thz pulse and serves as a reference. the eO modulation is analyzed by a polarimetric arrange-ment comprising an hWP, a Wollaston polarizer, and a low-noise, high–quantum-efficiency balanced detector. the temporal resolution is achieved by delaying the thzwith respect to the signal and idler pulses using a linear translation stage. note that the idler polarization impinging on the eO crystal is orthogonal (s-polarized) to thatof the signal, and both are rotated by 45° with an hWP before interacting with the linearly polarized thz field in the eO crystal, and then are rotated back to almost thesame initial condition before reaching the Wollaston prism.

### **How Does It Work?**
1. **THz Radiation Generation**: 
   - A laser pulse is used to generate terahertz (THz) radiation in a gallium phosphide (GaP) crystal.
   - This THz pulse is crucial for probing materials and molecules.

2. **Electro-Optical Sampling (EOS)**: 
   - The THz electric field interacts with a probe pulse in a **nonlinear crystal**.
   - This modifies the phase of the probe pulse, which is detected using a **balanced detector**.

3. **Quantum Enhancement Using Two-Mode Squeezed States**:
   - Traditional detection is limited by **shot noise**.
   - Quantum-entangled photons (**twin beams**) are used to reduce this noise.
   - This results in a **twofold noise reduction** and improves sensitivity.

4. **Spectroscopy**:
   - The method allows high-precision measurements of spectral data.
   - It improves both amplitude and phase measurements of the THz field.

### **How Can We Use It?**
This technique has potential applications in:
- **Security screening**
- **Quality control**
- **Medical diagnostics**
- **Chemical composition analysis**
- **Environmental monitoring (air, water, and food safety)**
