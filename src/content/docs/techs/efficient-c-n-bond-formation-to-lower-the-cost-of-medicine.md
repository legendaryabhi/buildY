title: Efficient C−N Bond Formation to lower the cost of medicine
description: AshPhos is derived from an electron-rich aryl system, designed to enhance chelation with palladium catalysts.
---

The AshPhos ligand is a newly developed phosphine ligand that significantly enhances Buchwald−Hartwig aminations, a key reaction in pharmaceutical synthesis. This ligand is designed to improve catalytic efficiency, especially for challenging heteroaryl halides and sterically hindered amines that often show poor reactivity with existing catalysts.

### **How It Works**  

1. **Ligand Structure & Chelation**  
   - AshPhos is derived from an **electron-rich aryl system**, designed to enhance chelation with **palladium catalysts**.
   - This structure stabilizes the catalyst and prevents **deactivation**, which is a common issue with five- and six-membered heteroaryl halides.

2. **Catalytic Mechanism**  
   - **Oxidative Addition**: The Pd(0)-AshPhos complex undergoes oxidative addition with the heteroaryl bromide/chloride.  
   - **Transmetalation**: The amine reacts with the palladium complex.  
   - **Reductive Elimination**: The final C−N bond is formed, regenerating the catalyst for another cycle.  
   - **Avoiding Dormant Species**: At **elevated temperatures (70-90°C)**, AshPhos prevents the formation of catalytically inactive species.  

3. **Key Benefits**  
   - **Lower Cost**: Made from **affordable materials** with a **simpler synthesis** (1–2 steps).  
   - **High Yield**: Works with **over 55 challenging substrates**, including sterically hindered and heteroatom-rich amines.  
   - **Broad Scope**: Effective for both **heteroaryl bromides and chlorides**.  
   - **Sustainability**: Uses **low palladium loadings** and avoids expensive bases or solvents.

### **Implementation Guide**  

#### **1. Materials Required**  
- **AshPhos ligand**  
- **Palladium precatalyst** ([Pd(crotyl)Cl]₂ recommended)  
- **Heteroaryl bromide or chloride**  
- **Cyclic secondary or bulky amine**  
- **Base** (NaOtBu preferred)  
- **Solvent** (THF or toluene)  

#### **2. Reaction Conditions**  
- **Standard Conditions**:  
  - **[Pd] loading**: 1–3 mol%  
  - **AshPhos loading**: 2–6 mol%  
  - **Base**: 2.0 equivalents of NaOtBu  
  - **Solvent**: THF or toluene  
  - **Temperature**: 70–90°C  
  - **Reaction Time**: 12–16 hours  

- **Optimized Protocol** (Example for thiophenyl bromide + tert-butylamine):  
  - 0.5 mmol heteroaryl bromide  
  - 0.6 mmol amine  
  - 1 mol% [Pd(crotyl)Cl]₂  
  - 2 mol% AshPhos  
  - 2.0 equiv NaOtBu  
  - 1 mL THF  
  - 70°C for 16 h  

- **Alternative Conditions for Heteroaryl Chlorides**:  
  - **Higher Pd and AshPhos loading** (3 mol% Pd, 6 mol% AshPhos)  
  - **Higher temperature (90°C)**  

#### **3. Workup & Purification**  
- Reaction is monitored by **TLC or GC-MS**.  
- The crude product is purified by **column chromatography** using **EtOAc/hexanes** as eluent.
