### Idea Proposed

Supramolecular dyads, particularly those involving photogenerated spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs), are emerging as promising candidates for qubit applications in quantum computing and sensing. These dyads leverage the unique properties of radical pairs, which can exist in entangled spin states, making them suitable for quantum information science. 

The following sections detail their potential and the advancements in this field.

#### Photogenerated Spin-Correlated Radical Pairs

- SCRPs can exist in singlet and triplet states, allowing for quantum superposition, essential for qubit functionality.
- The ability to prepare these pairs in pure, entangled states enhances their utility in quantum applications.

#### Synthetic Accessibility and Control

- Recent advancements in molecular engineering have led to the development of donor-bridge-acceptor systems that exhibit significant magnetic field effects, crucial for controlling qubit properties.
- The tunability of these systems allows for precise manipulation of quantum states, enhancing their performance as qubits.

### Applications in Quantum Sensing

- The sensitivity of SCRPs to external magnetic fields enables their use in advanced sensing technologies, such as magnetometers and resolution-enhanced imaging.
- The potential for molecular quantum sensors represents a significant leap beyond classical sensing methods.

While the prospects for supramolecular dyads as qubit candidates are promising, challenges remain in achieving optimal spin-qubit addressability and coherence, which are critical for practical applications in quantum computing.
