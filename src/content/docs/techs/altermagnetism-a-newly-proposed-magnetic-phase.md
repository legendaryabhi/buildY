> a, Unit cell of α-MnTe with Mn spins collinear to the magnetic easy axis. Applying transforms the left unit cell into the right. The unit cells with opposite L vector produce the same XMLD but inequivalent XMCD owing to-symmetry breaking in altermagnetic MnTe. b, Illustration of the vector mapping process. The colour wheels show the angular dependence of the XMCD, three-colour XMLD and six-colour vector map on the in-plane vector direction. The XMCD acts on the three-colour XMLD, with light XMCD regions changing the colour and dark XMCD regions leaving it unchanged to produce the six-colour L-vector map. In the XMLD and vector map, coloured segments indicate the magnetic easy axes oriented along the crystallographic directions. c–e, XMCD-PEEM (c), XMLD-PEEM (d) and vector map (e) of a 25-μm2 region of unpatterned MnTe film. f, An expanded view of the boxed region in e in which a vortex–antivortex pair is identified. The vortex–antivortex core positions are highlighted by the magenta–white and cyan–white circles, respectively. The combination of XMLD-PEEM and XMCD-PEEM imaging allows for unambiguous determination of the helicity of the swirling textures of the altermagnetic order vector, indicated by the six colours and overlaid vector plot. Scale bars, 1 μm (c) and 250 nm (f). g, X-ray absorption spectrum (XAS), plotted in black, and XMCD spectrum, plotted in red, measured across the Mn L2,3 resonant edges. The XMCD spectrum is scaled by ×50. a.u., arbitrary units.

Altermagnetism, a newly proposed magnetic phase that combines key features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets.

### **How Altermagnetism Works**
This method uses **X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)** and **X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) with photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM)** to image and control **nanoscale spin configurations** in MnTe. 

- **Altermagnetic Order Mapping**: The method maps the spin order at the **nanoscale (100 nm)** and up to **microscale (10 µm)**.
- **Patterning and Field Cooling**: Microstructured MnTe films are thermally cycled in magnetic fields to impose **custom spin configurations**, including **vortices and single-domain states**.
- **Spin Polarization Detection**: XMCD reveals time-reversal symmetry breaking, distinguishing altermagnets from antiferromagnets.
- **Scalability**: The method demonstrates that **spintronic devices** based on altermagnetism can be highly scalable, energy-efficient, and resistant to external field disturbances.

### **How We Can Use It**
1. **Spintronic Devices**: Can be used in **memory and logic devices** with **low energy consumption**.
2. **Neuromorphic Computing**: Altermagnetic textures like vortices and domain walls can be used for **brain-inspired AI chips**.
3. **Superconductor Integration**: Because they lack net magnetization, altermagnets can be integrated into **superconducting circuits**.
4. **High-Speed Electronics**: Altermagnets allow ultrafast spin switching, improving **data storage and computing speeds**.

This method paves the way for **new quantum materials, next-gen computing, and energy-efficient electronics**.
