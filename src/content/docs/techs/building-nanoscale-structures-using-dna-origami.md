title: Building Nanoscale Structures using DNA Origami
description: a modular DNA origami unit that can be reconfigured into a vast number of unique monomers

### Idea Proposed

“moDON” – a modular DNA origami unit that can be reconfigured into a vast number of unique monomers (up to 59,049 variants) using a single set of DNA staples. Essentially, it’s a method for creating fully addressable, designer superstructures at the nanoscale. The work combines two distinct connection strategies (in-plane “xy” and out-of-plane “z”) to form larger, more complex assemblies than conventional DNA origami allows.

### How It Works
1. **Modular Design:**
   - **XY-Direction:** Modularity is achieved by re-routing the DNA scaffold to create shape-complementary connection sites (protrusions and indentations). These sites are designed to be specific, allowing multiple moDON units to assemble into defined planar (2D) superstructures.
   - **Z-Direction:** A three-strand connection system is used to connect moDONs in the third dimension. Here, directional DNA handles and connector strands allow the formation of robust, non-branching connections between layers.
   
2. **Assembly and Disassembly:**
   - **Assembly Triggers:** High concentrations of MgCl₂ promote the xy-assembly by stabilizing the DNA duplexes, while the addition of specific connector strands triggers z-assembly.
   - **Controlled Disassembly:** The system can be disassembled selectively. For example, toehold-mediated strand displacement is used to remove the z-connectors, and lowering the MgCl₂ concentration can disassemble xy-connections. This orthogonality allows for dynamic control over the structure.

### How You Can Use This
- **Research and Development:** Use the modular design to create custom nanoscale structures for applications in sensing, molecular electronics, or as scaffolds for functional molecules.
- **Synthetic Biology:** The approach offers a way to build cytoskeleton-like structures or reconfigurable platforms that can dynamically assemble and disassemble, which is valuable for mimicking biological systems or for drug delivery platforms.
- **Cost-Effective Nanofabrication:** By using a single set of staples to generate thousands of unique monomers, this method significantly reduces the design and production cost compared to traditional DNA origami techniques.
- **Educational and Exploratory Applications:** The paper can serve as a basis for further studies in DNA nanotechnology, providing insights into hierarchical assembly, structural addressability, and dynamic control at the nanoscale.
