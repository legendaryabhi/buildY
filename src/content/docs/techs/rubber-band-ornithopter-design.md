The rubber-band powered ornithopter design presents a unique and innovative approach to drone technology by utilizing the principles of bird-like flight, powered by the simple yet effective energy storage mechanism of a rubber band. 

This design aims to harness the natural flight dynamics of birds to create lightweight, efficient, and agile drones that can fly with minimal mechanical complexity.
