A new approach, which takes minutes rather than days, predicts how a specific DNA sequence will arrange itself in the cell nucleus.

ChromoGen, a generative model based on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques that efficiently predicts three-dimensional, single-cell chromatin conformations de novo with both region and cell type specificity. These generated conformations accurately reproduce experimental results at both the single-cell and population levels.

Moreover, ChromoGen successfully transfers to cell types excluded from the training data using just DNA sequence and widely available DNase-seq data, thus providing access to chromatin structures in myriad cell types.

### Implementation 

The implementation of this method can be found on this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr8265).

### Made by MIT Chemistry

This method/model is made by MIT Chemists [Visit here](https://news.mit.edu/2025/with-generative-ai-mit-chemists-quickly-calculate-3d-genomic-structures-0131)

The researchers have made all of their data and the model [available](https://github.com/ZhangGroup-MITChemistry/ChromoGen) to others who wish to use it.

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.
