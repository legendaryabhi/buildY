This recycling method restores perovskite solar cells by dissolving degraded perovskite layers in an eco-friendly aqueous solution and recovering essential materials for reuse. 

### Process:

1. **Thermal Treatment & Delamination**:  
   - The perovskite solar module is heated to **150°C** for 3 minutes, softening the encapsulant (ethylene vinyl acetate, EVA).  
   - This allows easy separation of the glass cover and various layers.  

2. **Aqueous-Based Perovskite Recycling**:  
   - The perovskite layer is dissolved in water containing **sodium acetate (NaOAc), sodium iodide (NaI), and hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2)**.  
   - **Sodium acetate** enhances solubility by forming **lead acetate**, making the lead iodide dissolve efficiently.  
   - **Sodium iodide** ensures that the perovskite phase is preserved during precipitation.  
   - **Hypophosphorous acid** stabilizes the solution by preventing oxidation of iodide ions.  

3. **Precipitation and Recovery**:  
   - The dissolved perovskite solution is **cooled gradually**, allowing high-purity perovskite crystals to reform.  
   - The recycled perovskite can then be used to create **new high-efficiency solar cells**, maintaining nearly identical performance to fresh materials.  

4. **Holistic Recycling of Other Components**:  
   - **Hole-transport material (spiro-OMeTAD)** is extracted using **ethyl acetate (EA) and ethanol**, purified, and reused.  
   - **Gold electrodes** are collected by centrifugation and reused without further processing.  
   - **ITO-coated glass substrates** are cleaned and treated with **ultraviolet–ozone** to restore their optical and electrical properties.  

### **How to Implement This Recycling Process**  
1. **Set Up Recycling Infrastructure**  
   - Establish a **thermal treatment station** to delaminate perovskite modules.  
   - Create a **water-based processing unit** with controlled temperatures for dissolving and reforming perovskite crystals.  

2. **Prepare the Aqueous Solution**  
   - Mix **sodium acetate (500 mg/mL), sodium iodide (800 mg/mL), and hypophosphorous acid (40 μL/mL)** in deionized water.  
   - Heat the solution to **80°C** before dissolving the perovskite layer.  

3. **Recycle the Perovskite Layer**  
   - Immerse degraded perovskite films in the **hot aqueous solution** for 20 minutes.  
   - Remove the substrate and cool the solution slowly to allow high-quality perovskite crystals to precipitate.  
   - Separate and dry the crystals in a **vacuum oven at 60°C** before reusing them.  

4. **Recover Other Components**  
   - Extract and purify **spiro-OMeTAD** using ethyl acetate and ethanol.  
   - Collect **gold electrodes** through centrifugation.  
   - Clean and treat **ITO-coated glass** with **ultraviolet–ozone** before reuse.  

5. **Integrate Recycled Materials into New Solar Cells**  
   - Use the recovered materials to fabricate **new perovskite solar modules**, completing a **circular economy** for solar energy.
