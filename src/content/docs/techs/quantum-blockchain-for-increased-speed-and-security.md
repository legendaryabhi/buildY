The integration of quantum computing with blockchain enhances data encryption and transaction speeds. Quantum algorithms can process blockchain nodes faster, while quantum resistance ensures safety from quantum-based attacks.

### Implementation Details:

- Implement quantum hashing algorithms to ensure faster block validation.
- Utilize quantum random number generators (QRNGs) for creating cryptographic keys, ensuring unpredictability.
- Create quantum-secured smart contracts using quantum-resistant algorithms.
