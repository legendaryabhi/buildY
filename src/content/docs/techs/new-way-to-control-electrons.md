### Idea Proposed

Chiral-Induced Unidirectional Spin-to-Charge Conversion

This new method leverages Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) to control electron flow by using chiral moleculesâ€”molecules that have a "handedness" (left- or right-handed structures). When electrons pass through these chiral molecules, they become spin-polarized, meaning their spin aligns in a specific direction. This property allows for the conversion of spin currents (electron spins without charge flow) into charge currents (usable electrical energy).

### **How It Works**  
- A **pure spin current** is generated in a thin-film heterostructure made of a **ferrimagnetic insulator (YIG)** and a **heavy metal layer (gold/Au)**.  
- When an **external magnetic field** is applied, the spin-polarized electrons interact with the chiral molecules on the metal surface.  
- This interaction **selectively enhances or suppresses** electron transport based on the molecular chirality, leading to a **unidirectional spin-to-charge conversion** via the **Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE)**.  
- The efficiency of spin selectivity is **up to 60%**, which is remarkable for a molecular-scale system.  

### **How It Can Revolutionize Technology**  
1. **Next-Gen Spintronics**:  
   - This discovery paves the way for **energy-efficient spin-based devices** that operate without the need for external magnetic fields.  
   - Could replace traditional electronics, reducing power consumption in computing.  

2. **Quantum Computing & Information Processing**:  
   - CISS-based electron control could enable more **stable and efficient qubits** in quantum computers.  
   - Facilitates **room-temperature quantum operations**, removing the need for cryogenic cooling.  

3. **Ultra-Low Power Electronics**:  
   - Unidirectional spin control could lead to transistors and memory devices that consume significantly **less energy** than conventional semiconductor technology.  

4. **Sustainable and Miniaturized Devices**:  
   - Since chiral molecules are **organic and self-assembling**, they offer a sustainable way to create **nanostructured electronics** without expensive and rare materials.
