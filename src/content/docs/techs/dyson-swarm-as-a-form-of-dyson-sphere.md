It is found that a Dyson Swarm, a large array of individual satellites orbiting another planetary body, is the ideal design for such a structure over the solid sun-surrounding structure which is typically associated with the Dyson Sphere.

As Dyson himself pointed out, a complete Dyson Sphere is practically mechanically impossible, however, splitting this large structure into numerous smaller components which each contribute to the total output similar to a single sphere, vastly increases the ease of its construction. Similarly, by making the individual satellites of the swarm as simple as possible — a system of reflecting mirrors — the bulk of the technology is placed either on Mars, Earth, or in Earth orbit. This means that as our technologies advance over the roughly fifty-year construction time of the swarm, the capabilities of the whole system can be upgraded continually, increasing its efficiencies and reducing the time to reach desired power outputs, whereas should each satellite need to be upgraded individually, progress would be much slower.

### Advantages of a Dyson Swarm Over a Dyson Sphere

- **Structural Flexibility**: A Dyson Swarm consists of numerous individual satellites rather than a solid structure. This flexibility allows for easier adjustments and repairs, making it more adaptable to changing conditions in space .

- **Scalability**: The design of a Dyson Swarm can be scaled up or down based on energy needs and technological advancements. This scalability is a significant advantage over a solid Dyson Sphere, which would be a massive undertaking with less room for modification once constructed .

- **Resource Utilization**: The construction of a Dyson Swarm can be initiated on Mars, utilizing Martian resources for building the satellites. This approach reduces the need to transport materials from Earth, making the project more feasible and cost-effective .

- **Energy Efficiency**: The efficiency of a Dyson Swarm is estimated to be between 0.74% and 2.77% of the Sun's total energy output. This range indicates that even a partially completed swarm could still provide substantial energy, unlike a solid Dyson Sphere, which would need to be fully operational to be effective .

- **Construction Timeline**: The paper suggests that the construction of a Dyson Swarm could begin by 2040 and potentially meet Earth's energy demands within fifty years. This timeline is more realistic compared to the longer and more complex construction process of a solid Dyson Sphere.

- **Potential for Growth**: As technology improves, the efficiency and capabilities of the Dyson Swarm can increase. This potential for growth allows for ongoing enhancements and innovations during and after the construction phase, which is less feasible with a fixed Dyson Sphere design .
