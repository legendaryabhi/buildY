In our solar system, such a structure based around Mars would be able to account for the Earth's 2019 global power consumption of 18.35 TW within fifty years once its construction has begun, which itself could start by 2040. The swarm of over 5.5 billion satellites would be constructed on the surface of Mars before being launched by electromagnetic accelerators into a Martian orbit. 

<br>
Efficiency of the Dyson Swarm ranges from around 0.74 - 2.77% of the Sun's 3.85×1026 W output, with large potential for growth as both current technologies improve and future concepts are brought to reality in the time before and during the swarm's construction. Not only would a Dyson Swarm provide a near infinite, renewable power source for Earth, it would allow for significant expansions in human space exploration and for our civilisation as a whole.

Journey of radiation from the Sun to Earth through the Mars-based swarm. *Efficiency of transfer from swarm to mirrors can be estimated to be 70% including absorption of solar radiation in Mars’ atmosphere, dispersion of reflected radiation, and the land area uncovered by mirrors.
