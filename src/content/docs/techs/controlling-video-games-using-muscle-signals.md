This can be leveraged to create more advanced and immersive systems for human-computer interaction. By harnessing the power of electromyography (EMG), we can develop intuitive control systems that translate muscle activity into commands, enabling users to control video games or even other devices with greater precision and ease.

This innovative approach allows for a more natural, hands-free experience, reducing the reliance on traditional input devices like controllers or keyboards.
