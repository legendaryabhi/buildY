The **AFION self-driving lab** is an automated system that integrates:
- **Microfluidic reactors** (for precise chemical reactions)
- **In-flow spectroscopic nanoparticle characterization** (to analyze results in real time)
- **Machine learning algorithms** (to optimize synthesis conditions)

This system enables **on-demand synthesis** of various **plasmonic nanoparticles** without human intervention.

### **How does it work?**
1. **Automated Synthesis**  
   - Uses **microfluidic reactors** to control reagent flow and mixing.
   - Conducts **photochemical reactions** to synthesize nanoparticles.

2. **Real-time Analysis**  
   - Uses **spectroscopy** to measure nanoparticle properties (size, shape, and optical behavior).
   - Data is continuously collected and analyzed.

3. **Machine Learning Optimization**  
   - An **ML algorithm** (Gryffin) predicts the best reaction conditions.
   - The system runs experiments in a **closed-loop cycle**, learning from each result and improving synthesis conditions over time.

### **How can we benefit from this?**
- **Faster Nanoparticle Development**  
  - Instead of manual trial-and-error, this system **autonomously finds optimal reaction conditions**, reducing time and effort.

- **Higher Precision and Consistency**  
  - Produces nanoparticles with **highly controlled properties**, which is crucial for applications in **sensors, drug delivery, imaging, and photovoltaics**.

- **Cost-Effective and Scalable**  
  - Uses fewer materials and automates synthesis, making nanoparticle production more **efficient and scalable**.

- **Exploration of New Nanomaterials**  
  - Can **discover and optimize new types of nanoparticles**, leading to advancements in **nanotechnology and materials science**.
