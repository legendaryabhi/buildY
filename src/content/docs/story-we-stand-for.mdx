We exist for those people who build things to push the human race forward.

Those people don’t create things for money or fame; they create things to bring value to society. Creating value in society matters more to them than any amount of money or fame.

People often see them as the crazy ones because they aren’t like others. They don’t behave like others, they don’t think like others, and they often prefer staying alone, lost in creating something new.

Why do we exist for these people? Because I, the founder of Necrozma Labs, Abhinav Sharma, am one of them.

People like us are called misfits by the world, but we are the ones who build the future.

We are the ones who create things.
